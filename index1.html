                <p class="paragraph">
                LeetCode is one of the most well-known online judge platforms that you can use to practice your programming skills by solving coding questions. It has over 1,100 different problems, support for over 18 programming languages, and an active community that is always there to help you with the solutions you come up with. If your intention is to hone your coding skills, then this online judge platform is one of the best that you can use.<br><br>

&#8226;Most of LeetCode’s content is free, but LeetCode Premium enhances all of its positives by granting you access to things like access to premium problems and solutions, access to a built-in debugger, an autocomplete function, and interview simulations with feedback. It also makes it even more effective if you’re using it to prepare for technical interviews, as it grants you access to company-specific programming questions that you can use to have a better grasp of what you can expect from the questions you’ll face in interviews with companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, making it the ideal online judge to use if your sights are set on one of these FAANG companies.<br><br>

&#8226;However, as a tool for interview preparation, it’s lacking in certain areas. One of the cons that LeetCode has is that, while you can see the solution to problems, they don’t have an in-depth explanation of the DS&A/systems design concepts you’re using to solve these programming questions, which is a crucial part of the learning process.<br><br>

&#8226;Another con is that coding is not the only aspect that is evaluated in these interviews, even if it’s prioritized by other candidates. After all, the first thing that interviewers seek to determine is if you’re a behavioral fit for the company, and even you’re being evaluated on your programming skills, interviewers do not expect you to write perfect code on your first try (if you do, it’s likely that they’ll consider the question to be irrelevant).

                <p class="paragraph">
                Codeforces is a website that hosts competitive programming contests. It is maintained by a group of competitive programmers from ITMO University led by Mikhail Mirzayanov. Since 2013, Codeforces claims to surpass Topcoder in terms of active contestants. As of 2018, it has over 600,000 registered users. Codeforces along with other similar websites are used by top sport programmers like Gennady Korotkevich, Petr Mitrichev, Benjamin Qi and Makoto Soejima, and by other programmers interested in furthering their careers. <br><br>
                    
                   The Codeforces platform is typically used when preparing for competitive programming contests and it offers the following features:<br><br>

&#8226;Short (2-hours) contests, called "Codeforces Rounds", held about once a week.<br>
&#8226;Educational contests (2-2.5 hours, with 24 hours hacking period), held 2-3 times per month.<br><br>
&#8226;Challenge/hack other contestants' solutions.<br><br>
&#8226;Solve problems from previous contests for training purposes.<br><br>
&#8226;"Polygon" feature for creating and testing problems.<br><br>
&#8226;Social networking through internal public blogs.<br><br>


Contestants are rated by a system similar to Elo rating system. There are usually no prizes for winners, though several times a year special contests are held, in which top performing contestants receive T-shirts.<br><br> Some bigger contests are hosted on Codeforces base, among them "The Lyft Level 5 Challenge 2018", provided by Lyft or "Microsoft Q# Coding Contest — Summer 2018" provided by Microsoft.<br><br>

Contestants are divided into ranks based on their ratings. Since May 2018, users with ratings between 1900 and 2099 can be rated in both Div. 1 and Div. 2 contests. At the same time, Div. 3 was created for users rated below 1600.<br><br><br>
